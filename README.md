# Temperature Controller with an Aduino
### Skills: Ardunio, calibration, construction of power supply

Using an arduino, thermistor, and imersion water heater I explored keeping the temperature of water constant.

I built a power supply box out of an electrical switch, power chord, and an outlet box which was controlled by the Ardunio. 

Inputs went into the Ardunio from a thermistor which was calibrated (converting voltage differences to a temperature) from the following data.

When the thermistor input a temperature that was not the target tempererature the Ardunio signalled the powerbox to switch the heater on or off.
